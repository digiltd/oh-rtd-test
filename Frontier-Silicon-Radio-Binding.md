Documentation of the Frontier Silicon Radio binding for Internet Radios based on the [Frontier Silicon chipset](http://www.frontier-silicon.com/digital-radio-solutions).

## Introduction

This binding has been developed and tested with the [Hama IR110](https://de.hama.com/00054823/hama-internetradio-ir110) and [Medion MD87180](https://www.medion.com/de/service/start/_product.php?msn=50047825&gid=00) internet radios. 
The [MEDION® P85040 (MD 86988)](http://medion.scene7.com/is/image/Medion/50046868_PIC-Q?$m$) is also supported.

You can easily check if your IP radio is supported:

1. Figure out the *IP* of your radio (e.g. by looking it up in your router)
2. Figure out the *PIN* that is configured for the radio (somewhere hidden in the radio's on-screen menu); or try the default pin `1234`
3. Go to your web browser and enter: `http://<IP>/fsapi/CREATE_SESSION?pin=<PIN>`
4. If the response is similar to `FS_OK 6836164442`, your radio is most likely compatible with this binding
5. If you radio works with this binding, please add it to the list above by [Editing this page](Frontier-Silicon-Radio-Binding/_edit)!

For installation of the binding, please see Wiki page [[Bindings]].

The Frontier Silicon Radio binding is included since openHAB 1.7.0.


## Binding Configuration

Configuration is done in the openhab.cfg file (in the folder `${openhab_home}/configurations`):

    ############################### Frontier Silicon Radio Binding ###################################
    #
    # Hostname/IP of the radio to control
    #frontiersiliconradio:radio.host=192.168.0.100
    
    # PIN access code of the radio (default: 1234)
    #frontiersiliconradio:radio.pin=1234
    
    # Portnumber of the radio to control (optional, defaults to 80)
    #frontiersiliconradio:radio.port=80
    
    # The number of milliseconds between checks of the radio
    # (optional, defaults to 60 seconds).
    #frontiersiliconradio:refreshInterval=60000
    
    # Cache the state for n minutes so only changes are posted (optional, defaults to 0 = disabled)
    # Example: if period is 60, once per hour all states are posted to the event bus;
    #          changes are always and immediately posted to the event bus.
    # The recommended value is 60 minutes.
    #frontiersiliconradio:cachePeriod=60

Some notes:
* 'radio' is an identifier that can be replaced with your custom identifier, e.g. 'bedroom' or 'radio-kitchen'. This allows to use the binding also for multiple radios.
* The pin may vary from radio to radio, you can typically look it up in the radio settings.
* 'refreshInterval' and 'cachePeriod' are global settings that apply to all radios.


## Item Binding Configuration

There are different types of item bindings, all of them are qualified with the device's identifier used in the `openhab.cfg` file:

    frontiersiliconradio="<identifier>:<property>"

Example for the power state of a device with identifier `radio`:

    Swtich RadioPower "Radio Power" { frontiersiliconradio="radio:POWER" }

A list of all properties and their possible item types is given below:

| item | item type | purpose | changeable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POWER` | Switch | power state | yes
| `MODE` | Number | radio mode (details about mapping below) | yes
| `VOLUME` | Number | volume | yes
| `MUTE` | Swtich | mute | yes
| `PLAYINFONAME` | String | title of current playback, e.g. radio station | no
| `PLAYINFOTEXT` | String | additional information, e.g. current song | no
| `PRESET` | Number | select preset, e.g. configured radio stations | yes

The *radio mode* property is just a number that specifies the radio mode which may differ for each radio. This is why there is no fixed mapping implemented. For radios listed above, the mapping is as follows (please [add your radio mapping](Frontier-Silicon-Radio-Binding/_edit), if it differs!):

| radio mode | Hama IR110 | Medion MD87180 |Medion MD 86988
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Internet Radio | Internet Radio | Internet Radio
| 1 | Spotify | Music Player (USB, LAN) | Music Player
| 2 | Player | DAB Radio | FM Radio
| 3 | AUX in | FM Radio | AUX in
| 4 | - | AUX in | - 


## Example

Items:

    Switch RadioPower         "Radio Power" (gRadio) { frontiersiliconradio="radio:POWER" }
    Number RadioMode          "Radio Mode [%d]" (gRadio) { frontiersiliconradio="radio:MODE" }
    Switch RadioMute          "Radio Mute" (gRadio) { frontiersiliconradio="radio:MUTE" } 
    Number RadioVolDimmer     "Radio Volume [%d %%]" (gRadio) { frontiersiliconradio="radio:VOLUME" } 
    String RadioPlayInfoName  "Play Info Name [%s]" (gRadio) { frontiersiliconradio="radio:PLAYINFONAME" }
    String RadioPlayInfoText  "Play Info Text [%s]" (gRadio) { frontiersiliconradio="radio:PLAYINFOTEXT" }
    Number RadioPreset        "Preset" (gRadio) { frontiersiliconradio="radio:PRESET" }

Sitemap (presets and mode are radio-specific, this is why their mapping is specified here):

    Frame label="Radio Control" {
        Switch     item=RadioPower
        Selection  visibility=[RadioPower==ON] item=RadioPreset mappings=[0="1Live", 1="WDR2", 2="SWR3"]
        Selection  visibility=[RadioPower==ON] item=RadioMode   mappings=[0="Internet Radio", 1="Spotify", 2="Player", 3="AUX IN"]
        Slider     visibility=[RadioPower==ON] item=RadioVolDimmer
        Switch     visibility=[RadioPower==ON] item=RadioMute
        Text       visibility=[RadioPower==ON] item=RadioPlayInfoName
        Text       visibility=[RadioPower==ON] item=RadioPlayInfoText
    }


## Developer Info

If you would like to extend this binding and contribute further functionality, here is some technical information about it. The communication with the radio is realized via simple HTTP requests. Unfortunately, there is no official documentation of the API for the frontier silicon chipset, but there are some sources around the internet ([flammy/fsapi on github](https://github.com/flammy/fsapi/blob/master/classes/fsapi.php), for example). Until now, only the following requests are implemented:
* netRemote.sys.power
* netRemote.sys.mode
* netRemote.sys.audio.volume
* netRemote.sys.audio.mute
* netRemote.nav.action.selectPreset
* netRemote.play.info.text
* netRemote.play.info.name

If you like to add further actions, have a look at [FrontierSiliconRadio.java](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/blob/master/bundles/binding/org.openhab.binding.frontiersiliconradio/src/main/java/org/openhab/binding/frontiersiliconradio/internal/FrontierSiliconRadio.java).
