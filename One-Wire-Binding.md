Documentation of the OneWire binding Bundle
# Introduction 

The OneWire bus system is a lightweight and cheap bus system mostly used for sensors like, temperature, humidity, counters and presence. But there are also switches available. The binding is designed to work as client of the [ow-server](http://owfs.org/index.php?page=owserver_protocol) which implements the [owserver-protocol](http://owfs.org/index.php?page=owserver-protocol). The OneWire devices could be connected to the machine running ow-server by a USB-Adapter such as ds9490r or a serial-adapter. For detailed information on OneWire please refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_wire or http://owfs.org.

For installation of the binding, please see Wiki page [[Bindings]].

# Configuration (OneWire binding openhab Version >= 1.7.0)

If your 1-Wire Bus System is physically connected to your server and working properely please follow the steps:

1. Install and configure the ow-server and ow-shell packages on your 1-Wire server
1. Copy the binding (e.g. openhab.binding.onewire-<version>.jar in the openhab/addons folder
1. Edit the relevant section in the openhab configuration file (openhab/configurations/openhab.cfg). If you are running the 1-Wire server on the same machine please insert the local ip adress of the server (127.0.0.1) and not localhost in the line onewire:ip. In this case on every onewire update you will have an file system access to the /etc/hosts file.

# Generic Item Binding Configuration

In order to bind an item to a OneWire device, you need to provide configuration settings. The easiest way to do so is to add some binding information in your item file (in the folder configurations/items`). 

**Basic Configuration for an OneWire Item Binding**

	onewire="deviceId=<deviceId>;propertyName<propertyName>"

The sensorId can be either the hex address and an alias if one is configured ( http://owfs.org/index.php?page=aliases )

**Optional parameter refreshinterval**

	refreshinterval=<value in seconds>

If the refreshinterval is not set, the interval defaults to 60 seconds.

If the parameter is set to 0, it only reads the value on system start.
If the parameter is set to -1, the property is not read at any time.

**Optional parameter ignore85CPowerOnResetValues**

	ignore85CPowerOnResetValues

Ignores the power-on reset value (+85°C) of DS18B20 devices.

**Examples**

	onewire="deviceId=28.67C6697351FF;propertyName=temperature;refreshinterval=10“
	onewire="deviceId=28.67C6697351FF;propertyName=temperature;refreshinterval=10;ignore85CPowerOnResetValues“

# Type-modifiers

Type-Modifiers can be optional configured to the items. The binding provides the following modfiers. For example: by using modifiers you can calibrate onewire temperature devices or invert the value of contacts and switches.

### Number Items
* "add=<value>“ - the AddModifier adds a given value to a read-value on read. On write, the given value is subtracted of the value to write.
* "multiply=<value>“ - the MultiplyModifier multiplies a given value with the read-value on read. On write, value to write is divided by given value.
* "tukeyfilter“ -  Modifier to filter sensor data. Restricts the data point value to be between lowerbound = qbottom - alpha * r and upperbound = qtop + alpha * r where qtop = top n-tile, qbottom = bottom ntile, and the range r = qtop - qbottom. The original Tukey filter drops points if they are outside of 1.5 * range, i.e. alpha = 1.5, and takes quartiles. Another implementation wrinkle: for slow changing data such as e.g. temperature, the binding may pick up the same data point over and over again. This compresses the range artificially, and will lead to spurious filtering. For that reason a point is added to the sample set only if it is not present there.

### Switch Items
* "invert“ - the InvertModifier inverts the given Value to the opposite

### Contact Items
* "invert“ - the InvertModifier inverts the given Value to the opposite

## Configuration of modifiers:
The modifier name must be set in binding configuration:

	onewire="deviceId=28.67C6697351FF;propertyName=temperature;refreshinterval=10;<modifier-name>“

### Example
	
onewire="deviceId=28.67C6697351FF;propertyName=temperature;refreshinterval=10;add=0.8;multiply=1.2;tukeyfilter“

# AlarmSwitch

A special Binding is the binding of numeric one wire device propertis to openhab switch items. With this binding you can let openhab monitor your temperature oder humidity with simple rules. A switch turns on, when the read value from an device property is greater than maxWarning value or less than minWarning value.

**Configuration**

	onewire="deviceId=28.67C6697351FF;propertyName=temperature;refreshinterval=10;maxWarning=<value>;minWarning=<value>“

# Examples

### Number Item

	Number OneWireTempSensor "Temp [%.1f °C]“ {onewire="deviceId=28.67C6697351FF;propertyName=temperature;add=0.8;multiply=1.1;refreshinterval=10“}
	
This example uses the add and multiply modifier.

	Number OneWireTempSensor "Temp [%.1f °C]“ {onewire="deviceId=28.67C6697351FF;propertyName=temperature;add=0.8;tukeyfilter;refreshinterval=10“}
	
This example uses the add modifier and the tukey filter.

### Switch Item
	
	Switch OneWireSwitch "OneWireSwitch 6 [%s]"	{onewire="deviceId=29.F2FBE3467CC2;propertyName=PIO.6;invert;refreshinterval=10“}
	
This example uses a (inverted) PIO of an DS2408 as Switch, which can be turned on and off. The logic of the OneWire PIO is inverted in OpenHab (On=OFF and OFF=ON) by the InvertModifier

	Switch OneWireSwitch "OneWireSwitch 6 [%s]" {onewire="deviceId=29.F2FBE3467CC2;propertyName=PIO.6;refreshinterval=10“}
	
Same example as before, but the logic is not inverted.

### Contact Item

	Contact OneWireSensorA "Sensor A [%s]" {onewire="deviceId=12.4AEC29CDBAAB;propertyName=sensed.A;invert;refreshinterval=15"}
	
This example uses a sensedA property of an DS2406 as Contact, which is inverted by the InvertModifier.

### Alarm Switch
	
	Switch OneWireTempWarnMax "TempWarnMax [%s]" {onewire="deviceId=28.67C6697351FF;propertyName=temperature;refreshinterval=5;maxWarning=30“}

Switch turns on, when value of device property is greater then maxWarning (30)

	Switch OneWireTempWarnMin "TempWarnMin [%s]" onewire="deviceId=28.67C6697351FF;propertyName=temperature;refreshinterval=10;minWarning=5“}

Switch turns on, when value of device property is less then minWarning (5)

	Switch OneWireTempWarnMin "TempWarnMin [%s]" onewire="deviceId=28.67C6697351FF;propertyName=temperature;refreshinterval=10;maxWarning=30;minWarning=5“}

Switch turns on, when value of device property s greater then maxWarning (30) or is less then minWarning (5)

### LCD - Display

Example for writing messages to a HD44780 Display, controlled by an DS2408: http://owfs.org/index.php?page=lcd

I use a 4 bit wiring, so i have some free PIOs for push buttons: http://owfs.org/uploads/LCD%20Driver%20v2.0%20Schematic.pdf 

Items

	String 	OneWireLcdText		"LCD Text [%s]"	{onewire="deviceId=29.44C80E000000;propertyName=LCD_H/message;refreshinterval=-1"}
	Switch 	OneWireLcdStrobe	"LCD Strobe [%s]"	{onewire="deviceId=29.44C80E000000;propertyName=strobe;refreshinterval=-1"}
	Number 	OneWireLcdByte		"LCD Byte [%d]"		{onewire="deviceId=29.44C80E000000;propertyName=PIO.BYTE;refreshinterval=-1"}
	Switch 	OneWireLcdClear		"LCD Clear [%s]"	{onewire="deviceId=29.44C80E000000;propertyName=LCD_H/clear;refreshinterval=-1"}

Rule

	rule "write2LCD"
	when
	   Time cron "0/10 * * * * ?"	
	then		
		var String lvText4LCD = "OpenHab";
				
		//Init and clear display
		OneWireLcdStrobe.sendCommand(ON)
		OneWireLcdByte.sendCommand(255)
		OneWireLcdClear.sendCommand(ON)
		
		//Write 2 LCD
		OneWireLcdText.sendCommand(lvText4LCD)
		
		//Set PIOs to GND
		OneWireLcdByte.sendCommand(255)
	end

# Cache

## Config
The cache is active by default, so only changed values will be written to the Event-Bus.
If you want to disable the cache, you have to set 

	onewire:post_only_changed_values=false 

in the obenhab.cfg file.

## Problems
Because of unpredictably startup behavior of OpenHab, i somteimes see on my system, that OneWire-Bindings starts to read and cache items from onewire-bus, bevore items get available in openhab. So these items stays Unitinitalized, until the onewire device state gets changed. 

Therefor i have build in 2 possible ways to reset the internel onewire-binding cache.

### All Items

	Switch OneWireClearCache "OneWireClearCache" {onewire="control=CLEAR_CACHE"}
When the Switch received command ON, then the whole cache gets cleared.

### One Item

	String OneWireClearCacheOneItem "OneWireClearCacheOneItem" {onewire="control=CLEAR_CACHE"}
You have to send the name of one item to the String-Item and the cached value for this item will be removed.

I use this with a simple rule. Every item (with binding to a onewire-device), which should be checked must be part of group grpOneWireDevices2Check.

	rule "checkOneWireDevices"
	when
 	   Time cron "0 /5 * * * ?"
	then
	    grpOneWireDevices2Check?.members.forEach[element1,index1|
	      if (element1.state==Undefined || element1.state==Uninitialized) {
	              logError("OneWire“,"State of OneWireDevice: "+element1.name+" is +element1.state.toString)
 	             OneWireClearCacheOneItem.sendCommand(element1.name)
 	     }  
 	   ]
	end


# Configuration (OneWire binding openhab Version < 1.7.0)

If your 1-Wire Bus System is physically connected to your server and working properely please follow the steps:

1. Install and configure the ow-server and ow-shell packages on your 1-wire server
1. Copy the binding (e.g. openhab.binding.onewire-1.1.0.jar in the openhab/addons folder
1. Edit the relevant section in the openhab configuration file (openhab/configurations/openhab.cfg). If you are running the 1-wire server on the same machine please insert the local ip adress of the server (127.0.0.1) and not localhost in the line onewire:ip. In this case on every onewire update you will have an file system access to the /etc/hosts file.

# Generic Item Binding Configuration

In order to bind an item to a OneWire device, you need to provide configuration settings. The easiest way to do so is to add some binding information in your item file (in the folder configurations/items`). The syntax for the OneWire binding configuration string is explained here:

    onewire="<sensorId>#<unitId>"

Here are some examples of valid binding configuration strings:

    onewire="26.AF9C32000000#temperature"
    onewire="26.AF9C32000000#humidity"

The sensorId can be either the hex address and an alias if one is configured ( http://owfs.org/index.php?page=aliases )

    onewire="bedroom#temperature"

As a result, your lines in the items file might look like the following:

    Number Temperature_FF_Office 	"Temperature [%.1f ¬∞C]"	<temperature>	(FF_Office)		{ onewire="26.AF9C32000000#temperature" }
