## [[MiOS Binding|MiOS-Binding]] and [[MiOS Action|MiOS-Action]] Examples

This document is intended to provide [[MiOS Binding|MiOS-Binding]] users with real-world example openHAB configurations.

Users typically have configurations falling into one or more of the following categories, which will be used to outline any subsequent examples:

* Augmenting - openHAB Rules that "add" to existing MiOS Scenes.
* Co-existing - Replacing MiOS Scenes with openHAB Rules, but keeping the Devices.
* Replacing - wholesale replacement of MiOS functionality (Devices|Scenes) with openHAB equivalent functionality.

### Examples for Augmenting
#### Adding Notifications and Text-to-Speech (TTS) when a House Alarm is triggered
MiOS has a standardized definition that most Alarm Panel plugins adhere to (DSC, Ademco, GE Caddx, Paradox, etc).  This exposes a standardized UPnP-style attribute, `AlarmPartition2/Alarm`, for the Alarm System being in active _Alarm_ mode.  It has the value `None` or `Alarm`.

Here we check the specific transition between those two states as we want to avoid being re-notified, when the `Uninitialized` Â» `Alarm` state transition occurs, should openHAB restart.

Item declaration (`house.items`):
```xtend
String   AlarmArea1Alarm "Alarm Area 1 Alarm [%s]" (GAlarmArea1) {mios="unit:house,device:228/service/AlarmPartition2/Alarm"}
String   AlarmArea1ArmMode "Alarm Area 1 Arm Mode [%s]" (GAlarmArea1) {mios="unit:house,device:228/service/AlarmPartition2/ArmMode"}
String   AlarmArea1LastUser "Alarm Area 1 Last User [%s]" (GAlarmArea1) {mios="unit:house,device:228/service/AlarmPartition2/LastUser"}
```

Rule declaration (`house-alarm.rules`):
```xtend
rule "Alarm Panel Breach"
when
	Item AlarmArea1Alarm changed to Active
then
	pushNotification("House-Alarm", "House in ALARM!! Notification")
	say("Alert: House in Alarm Notification")
end

rule "Alarm Panel Armed (Any)"
when
	Item AlarmArea1ArmMode changed from Disarmed to Armed
then
	say("Warning! House Armed Notification")

	// Perform deferred notifications, as the User.state may not have been processed yet.
	createTimer(now.plusSeconds(1)) [
		logDebug("house-alarm", "Alarm-Panel-Armed-Any Deferred notification")
		var user = AlarmArea1LastUser.state as StringType

		if (user == null) user = "user unknown"
		pushNotification("House-Armed", "House Armed Notification (" + user + ")")
	]
end

rule "Alarm Panel Disarmed (Fully)"
when
	Item AlarmArea1ArmMode changed from Armed to Disarmed
then
	say("Warning! House Disarmed Notification")

	// Perform deferred notifications, as the User.state may not have been processed yet. 
	createTimer(now.plusSeconds(1)) [
		logDebug("house-alarm", "Alarm-Panel-Disarmed-Fully Deferred notification")
		var user = AlarmArea1LastUser.state as StringType

		if (user == null) user = "user unknown"
		pushNotification("House-Disarmed", "House Disarmed Notification (" + user + ")")
	]
end
```

#### Adding Notifications when Battery Powered devices are running low.
MiOS Systems standardize Battery Level indications (0-100%) for all battery-power devices (Alarm sensors, Z-Wave Door Locks, etc) and Nest uses a simple "ok" String to represent the Battery Status.

Item declaration (`house.items`):
```xtend
Number   GarageDeadboltBatteryLevel "Garage Deadbolt Battery Level [%d %%]" <energy> (GBattery,GPersist) {mios="unit:house,device:189/service/HaDevice1/BatteryLevel"}
Number   HallCupboardZoneBatteryLevel "Hall Cupboard Battery Level [%d %%]" <energy> (GBattery,GPersist) {mios="unit:house,device:301/service/HaDevice1/BatteryLevel"}
Number   EXTFrontMotionZoneBatteryLevel "EXT Front Motion Zone Battery Level [%d %%]" <energy> (GBattery,GPersist) {mios="unit:house,device:302/service/HaDevice1/BatteryLevel"}
Number   EXTRearMotionZoneBatteryLevel "EXT Rear Motion Battery Level [%d %%]" <energy> (GBattery,GPersist) {mios="unit:house,device:396/service/HaDevice1/BatteryLevel"}
String   NestSmokeGuestBedroom_battery_health "Guest Bedroom Smoke Battery Health [%s]" <energy>       (GSmoke,GBattery,GPersist) {nest="<[smoke_co_alarms(Guest Bedroom).battery_health]"}
```

Rule declaration (`house-battery.rules`):
```xtend
import org.openhab.core.library.types.*

val Number LOW_BATTERY_THRESHOLD = 60 // for Z-Wave Battery devices
val String OK_BATTERY_STATE = 'ok'    // for Nest Thermostat and Protect devices

rule "Low Battery Alert"
when
        Time cron "0 0 8,12,20 * * ?"
then
        GBattery?.members.filter(s|s.state instanceof DecimalType).forEach[item |
                var Number level = item.state as Number
                var String name = item.name

                if (level < LOW_BATTERY_THRESHOLD) {
                        logInfo('Low-Battery-Alert', 'Bad: ' + name)
                        pushNotification("Low-Battery-Alert", "House Low Battery Notification (" + name + ")")
                } else {
                        logDebug('Low-Battery-Alert', 'Good: ' + name)
                }
        ]

        GBattery?.members.filter(s|s.state instanceof StringType).forEach[item |
                var String level = (item.state as StringType).toString
                var String name = item.name

                if (level != OK_BATTERY_STATE) {
                        logInfo('Low-Battery-Alert', 'Bad: ' + name)
                        pushNotification("Low-Battery-Alert", "House Low Battery Notification (" + name + ")")
                } else {
                        logDebug('Low-Battery-Alert', 'Good: ' + name)
                }
        ] 
end
```

### Examples for Co-existing
#### When Motion detected turn Lights ON (OFF after 5 minutes)
This is typical of a declarative Scene in MiOS.  In this case, the lights are left on for 5 minutes, and if new motion is detected in that time, another 5 minute clock is started.

The logging can be removed as needed.

Item declaration (`house.items`):
```xtend
Group GSwitch All

Switch   MasterClosetLightsStatus "Master Closet Lights" (GSwitch) {mios="unit:house,device:391/service/SwitchPower1/Status"}
Switch   MasterClosetFibaroLightStatus "Master Closet Fibaro Light" (GSwitch) {mios="unit:house,device:431/service/SwitchPower1/Status"}
```

Rule declaration (`house-master.rules`):
```xtend
import org.openhab.model.script.actions.Timer

import org.joda.time.*

import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock

val int MCL_DELAY_SECONDS = 300
var Timer mclTimer = null
var ReentrantLock mclLock = new ReentrantLock(false)

rule "Master Closet Motion"
when
	Item MasterClosetZoneTripped changed from CLOSED to OPEN
then
	logInfo("house-master", "Master-Closet-Motion Timer lights ON")
	sendCommand(MasterClosetLightsStatus, ON)
	sendCommand(MasterClosetFibaroLightStatus, ON)

	mclLock.lock
	if (mclTimer != null) {
		mclTimer.cancel
		logInfo("house-master", "Master-Closet-Motion Timer Cancel")
	}

	mclTimer = createTimer(now.plusSeconds(MCL_DELAY_SECONDS)) [
		logInfo("house-master", "Master-Closet-Motion Timer lights OFF")
		sendCommand(MasterClosetLightsStatus, OFF)
		sendCommand(MasterClosetFibaroLightStatus, OFF)
	]
	mclLock.unlock
end
```

#### When Motion detected turn Lights ON (if nighttime) and OFF after 5 minutes.

A variant of the above, this Rule has parts that only run at Nighttime.  Here we use the [[Astro Binding|Astro-Binding]] to compute daylight hours.  See the Astro Binding configuration for details on how to setup that Binding's `configuration/openhab.cfg` entry.

Item declaration (`sunrise.items`):
```xtend
DateTime ClockDaylightStart "Daylight Start [%1$tH:%1$tM]" <calendar> {astro="planet=sun, type=daylight, property=start, offset=-30"}
DateTime ClockDaylightEnd   "Daylight End [%1$tH:%1$tM]" <calendar>   {astro="planet=sun, type=daylight, property=end, offset=+30"}
```

Item declaration (`house.items`):
```xtend
Switch   KitchenSinkLightStatus "Kitchen Sink Light" (GSwitch) {mios="unit:house,device:99/service/SwitchPower1/Status"}
Switch   KitchenPantryLightStatus "Kitchen Pantry Light" (GSwitch) {mios="unit:house,device:425/service/SwitchPower1/Status"}
Switch   PowerHotWaterPumpStatus "Power Hot Water Pump" (GSwitch) {mios="unit:house,device:303/service/SwitchPower1/Status"}
Switch   KitchenPantryZoneArmed "Zone Armed [%s]" {mios="unit:house,device:426/service/SecuritySensor1/Armed"}
```

Rule declaration (`house-kitchen.rules`):
```xtend
import org.openhab.core.library.types.*

val int K_DELAY_SECONDS = 240
var Timer kTimer = null
var ReentrantLock kLock = new ReentrantLock(false)

rule "Kitchen Motion"
when
	Item KitchenMotionZoneTripped changed from CLOSED to OPEN
then
	logInfo("house-kitchen", "Kitchen-Motion Timer ON")

	// Ignore this Rule if the Motion sensor is bypassed.
	if (KitchenMotionZoneArmed.state != ON) {
		logInfo("house-kitchen", "Kitchen-Motion Not Armed, skipping")
		return void
	}

	val DateTime daylightStart = new DateTime((ClockDaylightStart.state as DateTimeType).getCalendar)
	val DateTime daylightEnd = new DateTime((ClockDaylightEnd.state as DateTimeType).getCalendar)

	var boolean night = daylightStart.isAfterNow || daylightEnd.isBeforeNow

	if (night) {
		logInfo("house-kitchen", "Kitchen-Motion Night Time")
		sendCommand(KitchenSinkLightStatus, ON)
		sendCommand(KitchenPantryLightStatus, ON)
	}

	logInfo("house-kitchen", "Kitchen-Motion Any Time")
	sendCommand(PowerHotWaterPumpStatus, ON)

	kLock.lock
	if (kTimer != null) {
		kTimer.cancel
		logInfo("house-kitchen", "Kitchen-Motion Timer Cancel")
	}

	kTimer = createTimer(now.plusSeconds(K_DELAY_SECONDS)) [
		logInfo("house-kitchen", "Kitchen-Motion Timer OFF")
		sendCommand(KitchenSinkLightStatus, OFF)
		sendCommand(KitchenPantryLightStatus, OFF)
		sendCommand(PowerHotWaterPumpStatus, OFF)
	]
	kLock.unlock
end
```

#### When opening/closing Windows keep Nest _Away_ state in sync to save energy.

This originally ran as a Scene on the MiOS Unit, but was replaced with an openHAB Rule.  The Items are a mix of Items, from an Alarm system running on MiOS, and the [[Nest Binding|Nest-Binding]], running locally.

Explicitly check for the `OPEN` Â» `CLOSED` state transition, to avoid issues when openHAB restarts (`Uninitialized` Â» `OPEN`) or when _duplicate_ values come in from the MiOS System (`OPEN` Â» `OPEN`).

### Examples for Replacing
#### Publishing data to SmartEnergyGroups.com (SEG)

I wrote [[this script|http://forum.micasaverde.com/index.php/topic,31212.0.html]] to publish data from MiOS to [[SmartEnergyGroups (SEG)|http://smartenergygroups.com]] for analysis.

Here's what you do to replace it with openHAB functionality:
