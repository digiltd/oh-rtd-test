## Example

     openhab.cfg

     #Yamaha Receiver 
     yamahareceiver:living.host=192.168.1.1
 
     .items

     Switch Yamaha_Power         "Power [%s]"         <tv>    { yamahareceiver="uid=living, zone=main,  bindingType=power" }
     Dimmer Yamaha_Volume         "Volume [%.1f %%]"             { yamahareceiver="uid=living, zone=main, bindingType=volumePercent" }
     Switch Yamaha_Mute             "Mute [%s]"                 { yamahareceiver="uid=living, zone=main, bindingType=mute" }
     String Yamaha_Input         "Input [%s]"                 { yamahareceiver="uid=living, zone=main, bindingType=input" } 
     String Yamaha_Surround         "surround [%s]"             { yamahareceiver="uid=living, zone=main, bindingType=surroundProgram" } 
     Number Yamaha_NetRadio  "Net Radio" <netRadio> { yamahareceiver="uid=living, zone=main, bindingType=netRadio" }
 
     .sitemap

     Selection item=Yamaha_NetRadio label="Sender" mappings=[1="N Joy", 2="Radio Sport", 3="RDU", 4="91ZM", 5="Hauraki"]
     Selection item=Yamaha_Input mappings=[HDMI1="BlueRay",HDMI2="Satellite","NET RADIO"="NetRadio",TUNER="Tuner"]
     Selection item=Yamaha_Surround label="Surround Mode" mappings=["2ch Stereo"="2ch","7ch Stereo"="7ch"]

the tricky thing are the `"` around `NET RADIO`, this Key (left from the equal sign) is a value that must be send to the receiver **with** the space inside. If you omit the `"` the binding sends only the `NET` and the receiver do's nothing. 
Same are in surround definition!
