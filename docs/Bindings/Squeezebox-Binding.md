Documentation of the Squeezebox binding Bundle

## Introduction

Slim Devices was established in 2000, and was first known for its SlimServer used for streaming music, but launched a hardware player named SliMP3 able to play these streams in 2001. Although the first player was fairly simple only supporting wired Ethernet and MP3 natively, it was followed two years later by a slightly more advanced player which was renamed to Squeezebox. Other versions followed, gradually adding native support for additional file formats, Wi-Fi-support, gradually adding larger and more advanced displays as well as a version targeting audiophile users. Support for playing music from external streaming platforms such as Pandora, Napster, Last.fm and Sirius were also added. The devices in general have two operating modes; either standalone where the device connects to an internet streaming service directly, or to a local computer running the Logitech Media Server or a network-attached storage device. Both the server software and large parts of the firmware on the most recent players are released under open source licenses.

In 2006, Slim Devices was acquired by Logitech for $20 million USD. Logitech continued the development of the player until they announced in August 2012 that it would be discontinued. Given the cross-platform nature of the server and software client, some users have ensured the continued use of the platform by utilizing the Raspberry Pi as dedicated Squeezebox device (both client and server).

For installation of the binding, please see Wiki page [[Bindings]].

Please note there are two parts to the Squeezebox binding. You need to install both `org.openhab.io.squeezeserver` and `org.openhab.binding.squeezebox`. The `io.squeezeserver` bundle is a common library used by both this binding and the Squeezebox action and handles all connections and messaging between openHAB and the Squeeze Server. This ensures you only need to specify one set of configuration in openhab.cfg (see below), which can be used by both the binding and the action.

## Common Configuration

First you need to let openHAB know where to find your Squeeze Server and each of your Squeezebox devices. This configuration is entered in your openhab.cfg configuration file and is used by both the Squeezebox binding and the [[Squeezebox Action]]:

    # Squeeze server
    squeeze:server.host=A.B.C.D
    [squeeze:server.cliport=9090]
    [squeeze:server.webport=9000]
    
#### Incorrect info in config comments

The openhab.cfg reads `squeeze:<serverId>.host=` and suggests that the <server> part is customisable.

This is incorrect and it should be `server` for example 'squeeze:server.host=192.168.1.13' (not `serverId`, or your custom server name) 

See example config and rules here [[SqueezeboxExample]] 
 
    # Squeezebox players/devices
    squeeze:<player-id>.id=<mac-address-of-player A:B:C:D:E:F>

    # Language used by squeezeboxSpeak as used by google ttl (en, de, fr,...) 
    squeeze:language=<xx>

NOTE: the `player-id` will be used in both the binding item configs and the action calls to defined which of your Squeezebox devices to communicate with.  
NOTE2: the mac-address of players is case-sensitive. Use small letters (a-f) if the address contains them.

## Item Binding Configuration

The syntax of an item configuration is shown in the following line in general:

    squeeze="<player-id>:<command>[:<extra>]"

Where `player-id` matches one of the ids defined in your openhab.cfg file.

## Squeezebox commands
| Command        | Purpose                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| power           | Power on/off your device  |
| mute            | Mute/unmute your device   |
| volume          | Change volume by 5%       |
| play            | Play the current title    |
| pause           | Pause the current title   |
| stop            | Stop the current title    |
| http:stream     | Play the given http stream (obsolete as there is now a new squeezeboxPlayUrl() action for handling this inside rules directly) |
| file:file       | Play the given file on your server (obsolete as there is now a new squeezeboxPlayUrl() action for handling this inside rules directly) |
| sync:player-id2 | Add `player-id2` to your device for synced playback |

## Squeezebox variables

<table>
  <tr><td><b>Variable</b></td><td><b>Purpose</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td>title</td><td>Title of the current song</td></tr>
  <tr><td>album</td><td>Album name of the current song</td></tr>
  <tr><td>artist</td><td>Artist name of the current song</td></tr>
  <tr><td>year</td><td>Release year of the current song</td></tr>
  <tr><td>genre</td><td>Genre name of the current song</td></tr>
  <tr><td>coverart</td><td>Address to cover art of the current song</td></tr>
  <tr><td>remotetitle</td><td>Title of radio station currently playing</td></tr>
  <tr><td>ircode</td><td>String of the catched IR code</td></tr>
</table>

## Examples

Here are some examples of valid binding configuration strings:

    squeeze="player1:volume"
    squeeze="player1:title"
    squeeze="player1:play"

As a result, your lines in the items file might look like the following:

    Dimmer sq_test_volume 	   "Volume [%.1f %%]"	{ squeeze="player1:volume" }
    String sq_test_title	   "Title [%s]"		{ squeeze="player1:title" }
    Switch sq_test_play	   	   "Play"		{ squeeze="player1:play" }
    String sq_test_ircode	   "IR-Code [%s]" 	{ squeeze="player1:ircode" }

NOTE: when binding the 'play' command to a switch item you will trigger 'play' when the item receives the ON command. It will also trigger 'stop' when the item receives the OFF command. The same applies for 'stop' and 'pause' except ON=>stop/pause and OFF=>play. This is so you can setup a single item for controlling play/stop by defining mappings in your sitemap:

    Switch item=sq_test_play mappings=[ON="Play", OFF="Stop"]

And whenever the player state is changed from outside of openHAB these items will be updated accordingly, since there is now no longer a separate item for 'play' and 'isPlaying'.

v1.4.0: Squeezebox binding can store the latest IR code (form the infrared remote) in a variable, which can be used to do some actions. Look at this rule:

    rule "IR Code catched"
    when
        Item sq_test_ircode received update
    then
        if (sq_test_ircode.state=="00ff32cd") {
            sendCommand(Licht_Schlafzimmer, ON)
            logInfo("IR Code rules", "schalte Schlafzimmerlicht ein")
        } else if (sq_test_ircode.state=="00ff708f") {
            sendCommand(Licht_Schlafzimmer, OFF)
            logInfo("IR Code rules", "schalte Schlafzimmerlicht aus")
        }
    end


##Additional Control of Logitech Media Server

Another method to gain some extra control of the LMS not provided by the binding is via HTTP GET requests. Using rules, a switch/number etc can be linked to the required HTTP GET request.

All available GET requests can be found on the LMS. 
In any browser enter `<IP Address of LMS>:9000`

Help button on the bottom left → Technical information → Logitech Media Server Web Interface
For the multiple player variable either the IP address or the MAC address can be used.

##Example for adding playlists

Item file:

    Number Squeezebox_PlayList	"Playlists”

Rule file:

    rule "Squeezebox_PlayList"
	when
		Item Squeezebox_PlayList received command
	then
		switch(receivedCommand) {
			case 0 : sendHttpGetRequest("http://<IP Address of LMS>:9000/?p0=playlist&p1=play&p2=<Name of Playlist>&player=<MAC Address of Player>")
			case 1 : sendHttpGetRequest("http://<IP Address of LMS>:9000/?p0=playlist&p1=play&p2=<Name of Next Playlist >&player=<MAC Address of Player>")
		}
     end

Sitemap file:

    Selection item=Squeezebox_PlayList label="Start Playlist" mappings=[0="<Name of Playlist>", 1="<Name of Next Playlist >"] 

##Example for displaying text

Rule file:

    rule "SqueezeboxDisplay"
	when
		<any event>
	then
		var String text= "Das ist ein Text mit variablem Inhalt: " + Item1.state.toString + 
		" und " + Item2.state.toString 
		var String url = "http://192.168.2.5:9000/status?p0=display&p1=&p2=" + text.encode("UTF-8") + "&p3=300&player=00:04:20:06:21:6d" 
                sendHttpGetRequest(url)
     end

The is UTF-8 encoded. The URL calls the squeezebox server at port 9000 with this parameters: p1=upper display line, p2=lower display line, p3=duration of display, player= MAC address of player
