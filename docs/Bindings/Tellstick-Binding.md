Documentation for tellstick binding

## Introduction

Binding is tested against Tellstick DUO, it should also work with a basic Tellstick.


Supports RF 433 Mhz protocols like: Nexa, HomeEasy, X10, CoCo (KlikAanKlikUit), Oregon e.o. <br>
See further information from http://www.telldus.com

Tellstick binding support currently Sensors (Temperatur and Humidity) and Devices (Switch, Dimmable and Dimmable without absolute level)

For installation of the binding, please see Wiki page [[Bindings]].
The addon must be downloaded from 
https://openhab.ci.cloudbees.com/job/openHAB/lastStableBuild/org.openhab.binding$org.openhab.binding.tellstick/
until we get it packaged into the addons zip.
## Binding Configuration

First of all you need to make sure that your JVM is matching your installed Telldus Center. 
This normally means OpenHab must run on a 32bit JVM for windows and a 64bit JVM for linux.
For windows the binding is hardcoded to look for Telldus Center in Programs Files ("C:/Program Files/Telldus/;C:/Program Files (x86)/Telldus/").
If you have trouble getting the telldus core library to work you can modify the library path using

    tellstick:library_path="FOLDER OF tellduscore dll/so"
If you don't have a Tellstick Duo or the number of device events is less than 1 every 10 minutes you should increate the max_idle:

    tellstick:max_idle=600000

You will have to use Telldus Center to add all your devices. It is also easiest to find the sensor ID by using the Telldus Center. To configure a device you need the name and type of device, to configure a sensor you need the ID and Type of sensor. I recommend using tdtool -l to list all your devices and sensors. Run OpenHAB in debug mode to see that everything starts up correctly and that you are receiving sensor/device updates.

### The item configuration for devices is:

    tellstick="<deviceName>:<deviceType>:[<specialCase>][<resendCount>]"

+ The **deviceName** must match the name in Telldus Center.  
+ The **deviceType** is either: Command for on/off, DimmingLevel for absolute dimmable device.
+ **SpecialCase** is used for the dimmable without absolute level(devices that is dimmable with clicking twice). For this case use Dimmable as specialCase.  
+ **ResendCount** is just number of times to resend command.

### The item configuration for a sensor is:
  
    tellstick="<sensorId>:<valueType>:[<useValueType>]:[<protocol>]

+ **SensorId** is the sensorId taken from Telldus Center or debug logs.  
+ **ValueType** is either Temperatur or Humidity, based on sensor.  
+ **UseValueType** is for special cases where the value in ValueType is actually something else, supports BatteryLevel (Humidity:BatteryLevel) and Motion (Temperature:Motion). This is implemented for homemade temp/humid and motion sensor [Forum](http://elektronikforumet.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=63772&hilit=telldus).
+ **Protocol** if you have multiple sensors with same ID you might need to specify the protocol to make it unique

##Configuration examples

Switch:

     Switch	GF_Dining_Aquarium "Aquarium" <aquarium> {tellstick="Aquarium:Command"}
Dimmer without absolute (dims when clicking **on** button twice):
   
    Switch	GF_Kitchen_Wall "Wall"  { tellstick="Kitchen Backwall:Command:Dimmable:1" }
Temp sensor:
      
    Number	GF_Kitchen_Temp	"Temperature [%.1f °C]"	<temperature> {tellstick="14:Temperature"}
Temp sensor with protocol defined:

    Number      GF_Temp "Temperature [%.1f °C]" <temperature> { tellstick="21:Temperature:Temperature:oregon" }﻿
Wind sensor

    Number      Outside_Wind_Avg "Wind Average [%d]"  <wind>  { tellstick="22:WindAvg" }﻿                  
Battery Level

    Number	GF_Kitchen_Battery "Battery [%d]" <battery> { tellstick="82:Humidity:BatteryLevel" }
