All students are facing the same problem while writing their Bachelor- or Masterthesis: they are lacking of time. openHAB helps them to focus on the really relevant parts of their work rather than "wasting" their time on implementing foundation/framework services.

### Connected Home Lab

TU Dortmund University - Communication Technology Institute

#### Abstract
For presentation and validation the Communication Technology Insitute realized the Connected Home Lab in 2013. Students can validate their project results in a appartement like environment. Futhermore proof-of-concept demonstrators show the results of research projects.

One major problem in the area of home automation and smart home is the number of different technologies, vendors and eco-systems. The usage of a middleware is necessary to provide uniform access to different ressources in a home network. 

openHAB offers a elaborated open source framework based on OSGI with commercially comparable UI and performance.

#### How did openHAB help

openHAB has commercially comparable UI and performance. This is why, we can focus on the communication technology and use the "higher layers" without modification.

#### Contribution

##### FritzDECT
We implemented the fritzbox-aha binding. By communicating with the daemon running on the fritbox, we can control and monitor the FritzDECT sockets.
##### Homematic with CUL
We implemented the Homematic binding with the CUL-USB-Stick. Instead of relying on the CCU (HM central station), OpenHAB can communicate directly over a USB 868 MHz transceiver with HM devices.

##### wMBus binding
Smart Home system will be integrated with Smart Grid applications in the future. Currently, smart meters with wMBus interface are rolled out in Germany. We implemented a wMBus binding, which communicates over a serial interface with a 868 MHz transceiver. With the correct serial number of the smart meter, the encrypted packets sent periodically (1 min - 10 min) can be received. This way, the energy consumption of the houshold can be monitored with OpenHAB.

### SML System project

Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera

#### Abstract / Description / Dates

The SMLsystem is a modular house built basically using wood. It was designed to be an energy self-sufficient house, using passive strategies and water heating systems to reduce the amount of electrical power needed to operate the house.

The energy supply of the SMLsystem is divided into solar power generation and a domestic hot water (DHW) system. The photovoltaic solar system is responsible for generating electric power by using twenty-one solar panels. These panels are installed on the roof and at the east and west facades. The energy generated by this system is managed by a device to inject energy into the house, or in case there is an excess of power, to the grid or a battery system. The thermal power generation is performed using a solar panel that produces DHW for electric energy savings.

#### How did openHAB help

All the systems are connected to a central openHAB instance, which controls the full house.

### URC Lab

Stuttgart Media University

#### Abstract

The URC Lab is a showcase for state-of-the-art smart home technology, paired with a user experience that is tailored to the individual users.  We use the Universal Remote Console technology (URC, standardized as ISO/IEC 24752) as a framework for pluggable user interfaces.  Different users get different user interfaces, depending on their needs and preferences, and depending on their controller devices that they bring with them.  This is a requirement for the acceptance of smart home technologies in the context of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). 

Note: The URC Lab is currently set up and will be fully functioning by end of 2014 approximately.

#### How did openHAB help

Through openHAB we can connect our gateway, the Universal Control Hub (UCH) with virtually any backend device.

### SmartCampus2014
Polytech'Grenoble

#### Abstract / Description / Dates

SmartCampus is an end-of-studies project at Polytech'Grenoble, led by 5 RICM students (studying Networks and Multimedia Communication) during 2 months. The aim of this project is to create an augmented reality (AR) and crowdsourcing application for the Grenoble campus.

In fine, this application will allow the user to access multiple types of information:
- crowdsourcing information, such as the length of wating lines;
- general information about buildings and various components;
- variable information like transport time-tables and cafeteria menus;
- sensor data, such as atmospheric and meteorological sensors.

Each building is managed by an admin who can handle the information published. He can also activate or desactivate sensors using a dedicated interface.

To simulate the real usage of our application on the campus, we created a simplified model of the Grenoble campus, using mainly carpeting and wood (laser-cutting technology).

#### How did openHAB help
We use openHAB to monitor and actuate in a unified interface several devices: sensors (moisture, air pollution, etc.) and actuators.

###IDEAAL Home Lab

OFFIS e.V., Oldenburg

####Abstract
OFFIS is an independent institute of computer science closely tied to the University of Oldenburg, Germany. A large part of our health-related research revolves around Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) -- developing and integrating technical concepts which improve home care and support for elderly and those in need.

The IDEAAL Home Lab is a laboratory built to showcase some of our research results, as well as allowing realistic evaluations and demonstrations. Over the years, we have developed and used a vast amount of different platforms, sensors and technologies to implement our ideas. OpenHAB helps us to bring together these technologies and to further utilize the information we collect.

####How did OpenHAB help
OpenHAB acts as a data collection and distribution node, facilitating access to all sensor data and allowing combined processing. Using rules and the various UIs, it also simplified the implementation of and access to different home automation scenarios.
