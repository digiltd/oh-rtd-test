# Introduction to setting up openHAB

__openHAB is a highly configurable and very versatile [Home Automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation) solution.__

Though it does have a bit of a learning curve, it is worth the time and effort required. Whilst it can be very quick to setup if you know what you are doing. It is recommended you browse this wiki, [visit the community forum](https://community.openhab.org) and watch a talk or two to get a good idea of what you will be installing before you actually do.

#### Problems?

Please refer to the [openHAB Community Forum](https://community.openhab.org/c/setup-configuration-and-use) if you are stuck, need help or have any requests or ideas. Github Issues are for bug reports.

Though as is good practice on any community, please use the search button before blindly posting a question. As chances are, your question has been asked (and answered) before.

Don't forget to be polite, remembering that the people who make openHAB are doing so for free :)

Have fun with openHAB!
