Documentation of openHAB's security features

## Introduction

To secure the communication with openHAB there are currently two mechanisms in place

- HTTPS
- Authentication

Authentication is implemented by `SecureHttpContext` which in turn implements `HttpContext`. This `SecureHttpContext` is registered with the OSGi !HttpService and provides the security hook `handleSecurity`. At least all authentication requests are delegated to the `javax.security.auth.login.LoginContext.LoginContext` which is the entry point to JAAS (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Authentication_and_Authorization_Service) !LoginModules.

The `SecureHttpContext` is currently used by the `WebAppServlet` and the `CmdServlet` which constitutes the default iPhone UI as well as the `RESTApplication` which provides the REST functionality.

## HTTPS

openHAB supports HTTPS out of the box. Just point your browser to 

`https://127.0.0.1:8443/openhab.app?sitemap=demo#` 

and the HTTP communication will be encrypted by SSL. 

If you prefer to use your own X.509 certificates, you can. [Configure_SSL](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Howto/Configure_SSL) has information on how to do that, and there's a
[step-by-step guide](https://gist.github.com/jpmens/8029383) specifically for openHAB users.

## Authentication

In order to activate Authentication one has to add the following parameters to the openHAB start command line

- `-Djava.security.auth.login.config=./etc/login.conf` - the configuration file of the JAAS !LoginModules

By default the command line references the file `<openhabhome>/etc/login.conf` which in turn configures a PropertyFileLoginModule that references the user configuration file `login.properties`. One should use all available LoginModule implementation here as well (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Tutorial/JAAS for further information).

The default configuration for login credentials for openHAB is the file  `<openhabhome>/configuration/users.cfg`. In this file, you can put a simple list of "user=pwd" pairs, which will then be used for the authentication.
Note that you could optionally add roles after a comma, but there is currently no support for different roles in openHAB.

## Security Options

The security options can be configured through `openhab.cfg`. One can choose between

- `ON` - security is enabled generally
- `OFF` - security is disabled generally
- `EXTERNAL` - security is switched on for external requests (e.g. originating from the Internet) only

To distinguish between internal and external addresses one may configure a net mask in `openhab.cfg`. Every ip-address which is in range of this net mask will be treated as internal address must not be authorized though.
