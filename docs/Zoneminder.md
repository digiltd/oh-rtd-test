### Zoneminder

I appreciate Zoneminder has the Zoneminder.pm api.  I attempted to use it but with most things zoneminder I found the documentation totally out of date and zero comments in the code.  So instead I achieved my goal by accessing the zoneminder mySQL database direct.  It works rather well.

This is a simple php script that can be executed from a linux commandline if you have the PHP packages installed.  I simply run it under "screen" at boot time with the command "screen -d -m /opt/openhab/scripts/zoneminderAlarm.php".

It serves two purposes:

1) Sets a switch in openhab when motion is recorded on my front drive.  Openhab uses the switch to sound a doorbell sound.  I have all sorts of rules governing when to sound the doorbell and when to simply record a missed visitor, how you have that setup is your own call.

2) The script updates openhab number items.  The items store a count for the number of events in the last 24 hours.

READ THE COMMENTS IN THE SOURCE CODE BELOW to set it up.  Hope this helps someone.
```php
    #!/usr/bin/php
    <?php
    /*
    THIS SCRIPT SERVES TWO PURPOSES.  THE FIRST HALF IS USED TO SOUND A DOORBELL WHEN A
    NEW EVENT IS DETECTED. BY DEFAULT ZONEMINDER MONITOR 1 IS USED FOR THIS AS THATS MY
    MONITOR THAT WATCHES THE FRONT DRIVE.
    
    **** CHECK THE SWITCH STATEMENT IN THE "CHECK FOR EVENTS" SECTION BELOW, BE SURE TO
    USE THE RIGHT MONITOR ID (SEE THE COMMENTS) ****
    
    THE SECOND HALF OF THE SCRIPT HARVESTS THE NUMBER OF EVENTS IN THE LAST 24 HOURS FOR
    ANY NUMBER OF ZONEMINDER MONITORS AND PASSES THE COUNTS TO OPENHAB
