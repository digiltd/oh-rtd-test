# Documentation of openHAB's security features

# Introduction

To secure the communication with openHAB there are currently two mechanisms in place

- HTTPS
- Authentication

Authentication is implemented by {{{SecureHttpContext}}} which in turn implements {{{HttpContext}}}. This {{{SecureHttpContext}}} is registered with the OSGi !HttpService and provides the security hook {{{handleSecurity}}}. At least all authentication requests are delegated to the {{{javax.security.auth.login.LoginContext.LoginContext}}} which is the entry point to JAAS (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Authentication_and_Authorization_Service) !LoginModules.

The {{{SecureHttpContext}}} is currently used by the {{{WebAppServlet}}} and the {{{CmdServlet}}} which constitutes the default iPhone UI as well as the {{{RESTApplication}}} which provides the REST functionality.

# HTTPS

openHAB supports HTTPS out of the box. Just point your browser to 

{{{https://127.0.0.1:8443/openhab.app?sitemap=demo#}}} 

and the HTTP communication will be encrypted by SSL. If one would like to add his own certificates please refer to http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Howto/Configure_SSL for more information.

# Authentication

In order to activate Authentication one has to add the following parameters to the openHAB start command line

- {{{-Djava.security.auth.login.config=./etc/login.conf}}} - the configuration file of the JAAS !LoginModules

By default the command line references the file {{{<openhabhome>/etc/login.conf}}} which in turn configures a !PropertyFileLoginModule that references the user configuration file {{{login.properties}}}. One should use all available !LoginModule implementation here as well (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Tutorial/JAAS for further information).

The default configuration for login credentials for openHAB is the file  {{{<openhabhome>/configuration/users.cfg}}}. In this file, you can put a simple list of "user=pwd" pairs, which will then be used for the authentication.
Note that you could optionally add roles after a comma, but there is currently no support for different roles in openHAB.

# Security Options

The security options can be configured through {{{openhab.cfg}}}. One can choose between

- {{{ON}}} - security is enabled generally
- {{{OFF}}} - security is disabled generally
- {{{EXTERNAL}}} - security is switched on for external requests (e.g. originating from the Internet) only

To distinguish between internal and external addresses one may configure a net mask in {{{openhab.cfg}}}. Every ip-address which is in range of this net mask will be treated as internal address must not be authorized though.
